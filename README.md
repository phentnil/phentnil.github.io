# Welcome to the GitHub Page of Phentnil

I have a lot of experience in programming, specializing in web development.

## Projects

I have several projects that I am currently working on

- [factor-calculator](https://phentnil.github.io/factor-calculator) - seeks out the closest possible combinations based on an ordered target dose when considering unit values in stock.
- [CGS4183](https://phentnil.github.io/cgs4183) - My Web Development class for the Spring 2022 semester.
- There are a few other minor projects which have much lower priority or that they are exploratory in nature without building a full project.
