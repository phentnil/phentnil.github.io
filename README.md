# Welcome to the GitHub Page of Phentnil!

I have a lot of experience in programming, specializing in web development.

## Projects

I have several projects that I am currently working on:
- [factor-calculator](https://phentnil.github.io/factor-calculator) - seeks out the closest possible combinations based on an ordered target dose when considering unit values in stock.
- [Satellite-Order-Forms](https://phentnil.github.io/Satellite-Order-Forms) - provides an order form for various satellite pharmacies within the healthcare system which need to order non-sterile compounded medications from our central pharmacy location.
- There are a few other minor projects which have much lower priority or that they are exploratory in nature without building a full project.
