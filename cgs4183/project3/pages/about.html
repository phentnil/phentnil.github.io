          <h1>About Starling Shrub Starters</h1>
          <p>Starling Shrub Starters was founded by Jason and Janel Starling in early 2022 when our journey as plant
            parents grew to a point that we wanted to share our experience with others. We felt very inspired to reach
            out into our community to help others begin their own journey as plant parents, even to those who felt they
            were incapable of fostering such care needed for these little ones.</p>
          <p>We began by establishing Starling Shrub Starters in our local area and identifying specific plant species
            which were easiest to grow in nearly any local home setting. Then we would make sure customers had all the
            tools necessary to cultivate the proper care for their new plants. We decided that offering consultation for
            various plant care needs would also be helpful as there were many questions customers would ask. This also
            gave rise to community workshops which focused on specific plant care topics.</p>
