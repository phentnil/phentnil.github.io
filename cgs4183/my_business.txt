                                   Our Story

Starling Shrub Starters was founded by Jason and Janel Starling in early 2022
when our journey as plant parents grew to a point that we wanted to share our
experience with others. We felt very inspired to reach out into our community
to help others begin their own journey as plant parents, even to those who felt
they were incapable of fostering such care needed for these little ones.
We began by establishing Starling Shrub Starters in our local area and
identifying specific plant species which were easiest to grow in nearly any
local home setting. Then we would make sure customers had all the tools
necessary to cultivate the proper care for their new plants. We decided that
offering consultation for various plant care needs would also be helpful as
there were many questions customers would ask. This also gave rise to community
workshops which focused on specific plant care topics.

                                  Our Vision

To inspire the community and help it grow! We believe in partnerships and
collaboration. Through workshops and consultations, we strive to be a positive
and helpful resource to the community.
